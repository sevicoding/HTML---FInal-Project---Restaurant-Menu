## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open `restaurant_menu.html` in any web browser.
2. Use the navigation links to jump between **Menu** and **Order Form**.
3. Browse food items in the menu.
4. Fill out the form to simulate placing an order.
5. Submit the form (currently, it won’t send data anywhere because no backend is connected).

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Add CSS for styling (colors, layout, fonts).
- Connect the form to a backend or database.
- Use `value` attributes in form inputs to better capture order details.
- Make the site mobile-friendly with responsive design.
